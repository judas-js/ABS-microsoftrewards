What can ABS do? 
Well, ABS can do many things, such as max out your daily searches and spoof 
devices.
Whats a spoof?
A spoof can bypass your device wall, and make it seem like your device is on another device. Sounds confusing right? It's like having a Computer, and spoofing it to mobile.
Can it do quizzes for me?
Yes, yes it can.
