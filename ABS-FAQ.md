# What can ABS do? 
Well, ABS can do many things, such as max out your daily searches and spoof 
devices.
# Whats a spoof?
A spoof can bypass your device wall, and make it seem like your device is on another device. Sounds confusing right? It's like having a Computer, and spoofing it to mobile.
# Can it do quizzes for me?
Yes, yes it can. It can autoclick answers for you. You just have to open a quiz in the rewards tab. If the quiz answers are wrong, it's not a **"This or that"** quiz and can still get you full points, even though you got them wrong. Pretty cool, eh?
