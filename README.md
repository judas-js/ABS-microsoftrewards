# ABS-microsoftrewards
Too lazy to do all this searching? So are we.
ABS can help with that. This ZIP file contains **no exe files** and no **harmful files**. However, your microsoft rewards account
could get suspended, so head my warning.

# How do I unzip the file? 
You can download a application that unzips files. 
I personally use this, [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) **(which is free!)**
# I downloaded 7zip and installed it. What do I do?
Left click on the file to see this popup.
